I obtained my Ph.D. from Nanyang Technological University ([NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/)) in Singapore. My research lies at the intersection of AI algorithm design, Agentic AI systems, and model optimization. I explore how intelligent agents can reason, plan, and interact with external tools, while maintaining computational efficiency and robustness. My goal is to develop scalable agent frameworks grounded in solid algorithmic foundations. You may find my latest research works [here](/publications).
