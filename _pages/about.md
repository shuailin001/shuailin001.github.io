I obtained my Ph.D. from Nanyang Technological University ([NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/)) in Singapore. My research focuses on AI algorithm design and optimization, with a particular interest in Agentic AI systems. I explore how large models can be structured into intelligent agents capable of reasoning, planning, and tool interaction, while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability. You may find my latest research works [here](/publications).
