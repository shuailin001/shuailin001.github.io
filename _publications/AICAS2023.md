This paper presents a convolved self-attention neural network model for gait detection and human activity recognition (HAR) tasks using wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors. By embedding a convolved window inside the self-attention module, prior time step knowledge is utilized by self-attention layer to improve accuracy. Furthermore, a simplified fully connected (FC) layer without hidden layer is proposed for feature mixer to reduce the overall network parameter amount since hidden layer occupies most parameters in the transformer encoder. Compared to the other state-of-art neural networks, the proposed method achieved better accuracy of 95.83% and 96.01% on HAR datasets UCI-HAR and MHEALTH respectively, with the smallest network size.
