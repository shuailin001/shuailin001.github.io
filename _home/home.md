I am a Ph.D. candidate at Nanyang Technological University ([NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/)) in Singapore, under the supervision of [Assoc Prof Goh Wang Ling](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp01105) and [Dr. Gao Yuan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuangaocc/?originalSubdomain=sg). My research interests lie in the realm of AI algorithm development, particularly in the context of advanced data analysis, model optimization, and innovative algorithmic solutions. This work is currently aimed at applying AI for the analysis of biomedical signals, emphasizing both computational effectiveness and energy conservation. You may find my latest research works [here](/publications).
